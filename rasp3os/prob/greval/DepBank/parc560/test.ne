^ Many fund managers argue that now's the time to buy.

^ And the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the heady period that is just behind them.
^ ``We were all wonderful heroes last year,'' says an executive at one of <w>Quantum</w>'s competitors.
^ At <w>Quantum</w>, which is based in <w>New York</w>, the trouble is magnified by the company's heavy dependence on plastics.
^ <w>Quantum</w>'s lot is mostly tied to polyethylene resin, used to make garbage bags, milk jugs, housewares, toys and meat packaging, among other items.
^ Benchmark grades, which still sold for as much as  50 cents a pound last spring, have skidded to between 35 cents and 40 cents.
^ Meanwhile, the price of ethylene, the chemical building block of polyethylene, hasn't dropped nearly so fast.
^ ``People were even hoarding bags,'' he says.

^ Until this year, the company had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up trade-group safety awards.
^ When a plant has just been running flat out to meet demand, calculating lost profit and thus claims under business-interruption insurance is straightforward.

^ For the first time, the 83-year-old justice finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent, rather than as a force in the high court's majority.
^ This role reversal holds true, as well, for his three liberal and moderate allies, Justices <w>Thurgood Marshall</w>, <w>Harry Blackmun</w> and <w>John Stevens</w>.

^ A plan currently under study gives Damascus two years to pull back to eastern Lebanon, starting from the time Beirut's legislature increases political power for Moslems.
^ September's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still persists, and the pessimism over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market's plunge Friday.
^ After falling for three consecutive months, the producer price index for finished goods shot up 0.9% last month, the <w>Labor Department</w> reported Friday, as energy prices jumped after tumbling through the summer.
^ Although the report, which was released before the stock market opened, didn't trigger the 190.58-point drop in the <w>Dow Jones Industrial Average</w>, analysts said it did play a role in the market's decline.
^ ``The overall 0.9% increase is serious in itself, but  what is even worse is  that excluding food and energy,  the producer price index still increased by 0.7%,'' said  <w>Gordon Richards</w>, an economist at the <w>National Association of Manufacturers</w>.
^ <w>CityFed</w> also said  it expects to shed its remaining mortgage loan origination operations outside its principal markets in New Jersey and Florida and, as a result, is taking a charge for discontinued operations.
^ For the nine months ended June 30, <w>CenTrust</w> had a net loss of $21.3 million, compared with year-earlier net income of $52.8 million.
^ Regulators have become increasingly antsy about <w>CenTrust</w>'s and other thrifts' junk-bond holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk-bond market.
^ <w>CenTrust</w>, however, touts the branch sale, saying it would bring in $150 million and reduce the thrift's assets to $6.7 billion from $9 billion.
^ One of Italy's favorite shows, ``Fantastico'', a tepid variety show, is so popular that viewers clamored to buy  a chocolate product, ``<w>Cacao Fantastico</w>,'' whose praises were sung each week by dancing showgirls -- even though the product didn't exist.

^ Just last week they announced they may make a joint bid to buy  <w>Ferranti International Signal PLC</w>, a smaller British defense contractor rocked by alleged accounting fraud at a U.S. unit.

^ At <w>Fidelity Investments</w>, the nation's largest fund company, telephone volume was up sharply, but it was still at just half the level of the weekend preceding <w>Black Monday</w> in 1987.
^ In the year-earlier third quarter, when the industry was in the midst of a boom, the company had net of $61 million, or $1.7 a share, on sales of $1.02 billion.
^ Investors -- taking this as a sign that a broad industry slump was in the offing -- reacted by selling the company's stock, which lost $3.25 that day to close at $52 in national over-the-counter trading.
^ ``Two years ago there were massive redemption levels over the weekend and a lot of fear around,'' said <w>C. Bruce Johnstone</w>, who runs <w>Fidelity Investments</w>' $5 billion <w>Equity-Income Fund</w>.
^ He expects <w>Aldus</w> to report earnings of 21 cents a share on revenues of $19.5 million for its third quarter, compared with earnings of 30 cents a share on revenue of 20.4 million in the year-earlier period.
^ <w>Mr. Benton</w> expects <w>Compaq</w> to unveil a family of high-end personal computers later this year that are powerful enough to serve as the hub for communications within large networks of desk-top machines.
^ Overall, though, the South and West still outpace the Northeast and Midwest, and fast-growing states like Florida and California ensure that the pattern will continue.
^ <w>Mayor Lynn Spruill</w> and two members of the council said they were worried about setting a precedent that would permit pool halls along Addison's main street.
^ And even if a nurse would wear flowers in her hair while on duty, if she were engaged she would know to wear them behind her left, not right, ear.
^ If <w>Mr. Mason</w> had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow <w>New Yorkers</w>, would the water be quite so hot?
^ And it has remained there, as evidenced by  its reappearance in a 1972 CBS sitcom called ``<w>Bridget Loves Bernie</w>'', whose sole distinction was that it led to the real-life marriage of <w>Meredith Baxter</w> and <w>David Birney</w>.
^ For instance, <w>Michael</w> dislikes <w>Jackie</w> not because he's a shrewd Jewish businessman, but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker.
^ The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end (and occasionally in the middle) .
^ But <w>Senate</w> supporters of the trimmer legislation said  that  other bills would soon be moving through <w>Congress</w> that could carry  some of the measures that had been cast aside, including  a capital-gains tax cut.
^ <w>White House Budget Director</w> <w>Richard Darman</w> told reporters yesterday that the administration wouldn't push to keep the capital-gains cut in the final version of the bill.
^ And a senior aide to the <w>House Ways and Means Committee</w>, where tax legislation originates, said there aren't any ``plans to produce another tax bill that could carry a gains tax cut this year.''
^ To the delight of some doctors, the bill dropped a plan passed by the <w>Finance Committee</w> that would have overhauled the entire physician-reimbursement system under <w>Medicare</w>.
^ Authority for the <w>Federal Aviation Administration</w> to raise $239 million by charging fees for commercial airline-landing rights at <w>New York</w>'s LaGuardia and <w>John F. Kennedy</w> <w>International Airports</w>, <w>O'Hare International Airport</w> in Chicago and <w>National Airport</w> in Washington.
^ The agency said  it reduced  its rating on the thrift's subordinated debt to B-2 from Ba-2 and will keep  the debt under review for possible further downgrade.

^ He recommends that investors sell takeover-related stocks, but hang on to some other stocks -- especially utilities, which often do well during periods of economic weakness.
^ I disagree with the statement by <w>Mr. Lantos</w> that one should not draw an adverse inference against former <w>HUD</w> officials who assert their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in congressional hearings.
^ ``We view Friday's market decline as offering us a buying opportunity as long-term investors,'' a recording at <w>Gabelli & Co.</w> funds said over the weekend.
^ Thus, when <w>Mr. Pierce</w> asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding, particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel, one must conclude that he held a good-faith, justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution.
^ The subcommittee, <w>Congress</w> and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with <w>Mr. Pierce</w>'s own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime.
^ In a similar vein, he adds that the anniversary of the 1987 crash and Saturday's full moon could have played a part, too, in Friday's market activity.
^ <w>Mr. King</w> of <w>Robinson-Humphrey</w> and others were quick to add  that they believe  the problem stemmed more from traders' inability to handle the volume of calls, rather than a deliberate attempt to avoid making trades.
^ <w>Jeremiah Mullins</w>, the <w>OTC</w> trading chief at <w>Dean Witter Reynolds</w> in <w>New York</w>, said proudly that his company executed every order it received by the close of trading.
^ Two years ago, faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories, market makers themselves began dumping shares, exacerbating the slide in <w>OTC</w> stock prices.
^ But she expects prices to rebound soon and is telling investors  she expects the stock market won't decline  more than 10% to 15% from recent highs.
^ <w>Joseph Hardiman</w>, president of the <w>National Association of Securities Dealers</w>, which oversees the <w>Nasdaq</w> computerized trading system, said that despite the rush of selling, he never considered the situation an ``emergency.''
^ More troubling is the prospect that the overall collapse in stock prices could permanently erode the base of small-investor support the <w>OTC</w> market was struggling to rebuild in the wake of the October 1987 crash.
^ The sellers on Friday came from all corners of the <w>OTC</w> market -- big and small institutional investors, as well as individual investors and market makers.
^ <w>McCaw Cellular Communications</w>, for instance, has offered to buy  <w>LIN Broadcasting</w> as well as <w>Metromedia</w>'s <w>New York City</w> cellular telephone interests, and in a separate transaction, sell certain <w>McCaw</w> properties to <w>Contel Cellular</w>.
^ Among other <w>OTC</w> issues, <w>Intel</w>, dropped 2 1/8 to 33 7/8; <w>Laidlaw Transportation</w> lost 1 1/8 to 19 1/2; the American depositary receipts of <w>Jaguar</w> were off 1/4 to 10 1/4; <w>MCI Communications</w> slipped 2 1/4 to 43 1/2; <w>Apple Computer</w> fell 3 to 45 3/4 and <w>Nike</w> dropped 2 1/4 to 66 3/4.
^ Average of top rates paid by major <w>New York</w> banks on primary new issues of negotiable C.D.s, usually on amounts of $1 million and more.
^ 8 13/16% to 8 11/16% one month; 8 13/16% to 8 11/16% two months; 8 13/16% to 8 11/16% three months; 8 3/4% to 8 5/8% four months; 8 11/16% to 8 9/16% five months; 8 5/8% to 8 1/2% six months.
^ Most often, they do just that, because stocks have proved to be the best-performing long-term investment, attracting about $1 trillion from pension funds alone.
^ ``If you bought after the crash, you did very very well off the bottom,'' said <w>Stephen B. Timbers</w>, chief investment officer of Chicago-based <w>Kemper Financial Services Inc.</w>.
^ ``The last crash taught institutional investors  that they have to be long-term holders, and that they can't react to short-term events, good or bad,,'' said  <w>Stephen L. Nesbitt</w>, senior vice president for the pension consultants <w>Wilshire Associates</w> in <w>Santa Monica</w>, Calif.
^ ``You could go down 400 points and still have a good year in the market,'' said  <w>James D. Awad</w>, president of <w>New York</w>-based <w>BMI Capital Corp.</w>.
^ <w>Food and Drug Administration</w> spokesman <w>Jeff Nesbit</w> said  the agency has turned over evidence in a criminal investigation concerning <w>Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc.</w> to the U.S. Attorney's office in Baltimore.
^ <w>Vitarine</w> won approval to market a version of a blood pressure medicine but acknowledged that it substituted a <w>SmithKline Beecham PLC</w> product as its own in tests.
^ The <w>FDA</w> has said it presented evidence it uncovered to the company indicating that Bolar substituted the brand-name product for its own to gain government approval to sell generic versions of Macrodantin.
^ By 11:59 p.m. tonight, <w>President Bush</w> must order $16 billion of automatic, across-the-board cuts in government spending to comply with the Gramm-Rudman budget law.
^ And he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for <w>United Airlines</w>, which includes a big stake by <w>British Airways PLC</w>.
^ The 1987 crash brought  the <w>Reagan</w> administration and Democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit, resulting in a two-year plan to reduce  the deficit by more than $76 billion, even though  the deficit actually rose by nearly $12 billion during that period.
^ Hill Democrats are particularly angry over <w>Mr. Bush</w>'s claim that  the capital-gains cut was  part of April's budget accord and his insistence on combining  it with the deficit-reduction legislation.
^ When an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation, Oregon <w>Sen. Bob Packwood</w>, the ranking GOP member of the tax-writing <w>Senate Finance Committee</w>, hailed it.
^ ``I just don't feel that the company can really stand or would want a prolonged walkout,'' <w>Tom Baker</w>, president of <w>Machinists' District 751</w>, said in an interview yesterday.
^ <w>America West</w>, though, is a smaller airline and  therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be.
^ Small investors matched their big institutional brethren in anxiety over the weekend, but most seemed to be taking a philosophical approach and said they were resigned to riding out the latest storm in the stock market.
^ <w>Marc Perkins</w>, a Tampa, Fla., investment banker, said the market drop is one of a tremendous number of signs that the leveraged take-out era is ending.
^ <w>Avner Arbel</w>, a <w>Cornell University</w> finance professor, says government regulators will have to more closely control program trading to ``win back the confidence of the small investor.''
^ <w>Atari Corp.</w>'s Portfolio, introduced in Europe two months ago and in the U.S. in early September, weighs  less than a pound, costs  a mere $400 and runs on three AA batteries, yet it has the power to run some spreadsheets and word processing programs.
^ ``I've had a lot of people trying to sell me services to find out how big it is,'' says <w>Tom Humphries</w>, director of marketing for <w>GRiD</w>.
^ Both palmtops are dismissed by notebook makers, who argue that they're too small -- a problem <w>Poquet</w> also encountered in focus groups, admits <w>Gerry Purdy</w>, director of marketing.
^ ``I can't imagine that you'll talk to anyone who won't tell you this is dynamite for <w>Compaq</w> and a stopper for everyone else,'' says <w>Gene Talsky</w>, president of <w>Professional Marketing Management Inc.</w>.
^ Shares of <w>Rally's Inc.</w>, an operator of fast-food restaurants, closed at $17 each, up from its $15 offering price and shares of <w>Employee Benefit Plans Inc.</w>, a health-care consultant, closed at $14.125, up from its $12 offering price.
^ The No. 2 auto maker disclosed last month that it wants to buy as much as 15% of the British luxury-car maker, the maximum allowed under current <w>United Kingdom</w> government restrictions.
^ But <w>Mr. Baker</w> said he thinks the earliest a pact could be struck would be the end of this month, hinting that the company and union may resume negotiations as early as this week.
^ ``We believe they could siphon perhaps two to three billion dollars from <w>IBM</w>'' over the next few years, said <w>George Weiss</w>, an analyst at the Gartner group.
^ But <w>Mr. Baker</w> called the letter -- and the company's offer of a 10% wage increase over the life of the pact, plus bonuses -- ``very weak.''
^ The <w>Fed</w>, which until Friday had been resisting moves to ease credit, is now poised to pour money into the economy if needed to soothe the markets.
^ That wasn't the case in 1987, when the dollar was so weak that some economists and government officials seriously worried that it might collapse, producing panic among foreign investors and diminishing the flow of foreign capital to the U.S. .
^ <w>United Auto Workers Local 1069</w>, which represents 3,000 workers at <w>Boeing</w>'s helicopter unit in Delaware County, Pa., said it agreed to extend its contract on a day-by-day basis, with a 10-day notification to cancel, while it continues bargaining.
^ If the reactions of executives gathered Saturday at <w>Hot Springs</w>, Va., for the <w>Business Council</w> meetings are typical, business leaders weren't overly rattled by Friday's decline.
^ And <w>Boeing</w> on Friday said it received an order from <w>Martinair Holland</w> for four model 767-300 wide-body jetliners valued at a total of about $326 million.
^ Though <w>Dow</w> has aggressively diversified into specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals, the company still has a big stake in polyethylene, which is used in packaging and housewares.
^ ``You will find the commodities off more than the others and the diversified companies about even or slightly better,'' says <w>James Wilbur</w>, a <w>Smith Barney</w> analyst.
^ <w>Searle</w> continued to operate in the red through the first half of the year, but <w>Monsanto</w> has said it expects <w>Searle</w> to post a profit for all of 1989.
^ A <w>Boeing</w> spokeswoman said a delivery date for the planes is still being worked out ``for a variety of reasons, but not because of the strike.''
